          My name is Raghav Mahajan, and I am a graduate of the Digital Media and IT program, specializing in Software Development, from the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT). I am an international student from India, now based in Edmonton, actively seeking opportunities in software development and cloud computing. 

          With expertise in front-end and back-end development and technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, React.js, and more, I have a strong foundation in creating user-centric solutions. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning Amazon AWS and cloud computing to stay updated with the latest trends in the tech industry. My passion lies in delivering impactful digital experiences and solving problems through innovative technological solutions.
